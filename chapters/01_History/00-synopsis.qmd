# Synopsis

Historically, there are two primary usages of "data science": the classical and the statistical. These linguistic usages index two traditions of working with data that continue to this day, where they have met and mingle in the context of the academy along with many other adjacent disciplines. Data science today is characterized by this encounter; it is hoped that an understanding of the origins of our words and ideas in this context will allow us to create a new and unified form of data science for the long-term.

The classical usage began in the 1960s in the US military-industrial sector and continues to this day in that area and in the data-driven sciences. Among the governmental and commercial organizations that adopted the term at that time, the Data Sciences Lab of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) formed in 1963 stands out [@afcrl1963]. This lab established a paradigm that grew out of the need to dynamically process vast amounts of sensor data in real-time to support decision-making and modeling of complex phenomena. Central to this paradigm was the use of artificial intelligence and computer visualization to extract patterns from "data deluge"---what today we would call "big data." Over time this usage evolved to include working with large, complex, and dynamic data sets in a variety of scientific fields, including physics, environmental science, and biology.

A secondary but hugely influential development of the classical usage appeared in Silicon Valley around 2008 [@hammerbacher2009; @yau2009]. By 2012 it was famously promoted by *Harvard Business Review* when it dubbed data scientist the "sexiest job of the 21st century" [@davenport2012]. In this usage, the paradigm of classical data science jumped from the military-industrial and scientific sectors to the commercial sector of so-called surveillance capitalism [@zuboff2019]. In this context the usage became wildly popular, prompting a high demand for data scientists in industry as well as for authoritative explanations of the nature of the role. This in turn motivated the formation of numerous degree programs throughout the academy in the US. It also elicited a strong reaction from academic statisticians alarmed by the perceived disconnect between data science and their own field [@davidian2013].

The statistical usage began in Japan in the early 1990s among academic statisticians concerned with the threats and opportunities associated with computational statistics, data mining, and other developments relating to the rise of available computing and surplus data. Chikio Hayashi coined this usage in 1992[@ohsumi2002]; by 1996 the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) adopted it as part of a conference title. This began a long engagement with data science that continues to this day in Europe and Japan[@hayashi1998a]. A parallel but shorter-lived version of this usage emerged in the US between 1996 and 2001 when a small group of academic statisticians unsuccessfully exhorted their field to brand itself as data science and embrace new developments in computational statistics and machine learning [@kettenring1997a; @wu1997a; @cleveland2001]. A third iteration of this usage was developed by traditional statisticians who viewed the rise of second-wave classical data science as a threat to their field that must be "owned"[@rodriguez2012; @davidian2013; @yu2014; @asastat2015; @donoho2017].

The classical usage developed in the context of an historically unique assemblage of networked data-generating and computational machinery that characterized post-war military and scientific endeavors. The primary problem faced in this context is what we can call data impedance---the endemic disproportion between the production of data by signal-generating instruments---from satellites and particle accelerators to smart phones and credit cards---capturing a wide range of natural and behavioral phenomena, and the ability to process and interpret these data, often rapidly, by means of computational machinery. In this context, data science emerged as an eclectic form of expertise associated with the pipeline of activities that begins with the acquisition of data, often from non-experimental sources, to its reduction and modeling, to its visualization and interpretation.

By contrast, the statistical usage developed in the context of an established academic field reacting to the very developments within which classical data science emerged. Each iteration of this usage was motivated by the perceived threats and opportunities opened by computational methods and the growing surplus of data being captured by databases and shared over networks. A recurrent theme in this usage is an attraction to machine learning methods developed primarily by computer scientists and a repulsion to data mining, perceived as an unprincipled collection of methods lacking in experimental design and mathematical grounding. In this context, data science emerged as a rebranded form of statistics that would encompass and enhance the good parts of the new computational methods while throwing away the bad.
