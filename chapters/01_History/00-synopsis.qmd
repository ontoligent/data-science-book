# Synopsis

Historically, there are two primary usages of "data science": the classical and the statistical. These linguistic usages index two traditions of working with data that continue to this day, where they have met and mingle in the context of the academy along with many other adjacent disciplines. Data science today is characterized by this encounter; it is hoped that a shared understanding of the origins of our words and ideas in this context will allow us to create a unified and thriving form of data science for the long-term. This historical account is offered to contribute to that shared understanding.

The classical usage of data science can be traced to the 1960s when it emerged in the US military-industrial sector. Among the governmental and commercial organizations that adopted the term at that time, the Data Sciences Lab of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) stands out [@afcrl1963]. The lab, formed in 1963, established a paradigm that grew out of the need to dynamically process vast amounts of sensor data in real-time to support decision-making and modeling of complex phenomena. Central to this paradigm was the use of artificial intelligence and computer visualization to extract patterns from "data deluge"---what today we would call "big data." Over time this usage evolved to include working with large, complex, and dynamic data sets in a variety of scientific fields, including physics, environmental science, and biology. This usage continues to this day in that area and in the data-driven sciences. It is represented by organizations like JISC, the NSF, and CODATA. Closely related to this tradition of data science is the growth of so-called fourth-paradigm science and the rise of database-driven methods of extracting value from data, specifically data mining and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD).

A secondary but hugely influential variant of the classical usage appeared around 2008 when the paradigm of classical data science jumped from the military-industrial and scientific sectors to the commercial sector of so-called surveillance capitalism [@zuboff2019; @hammerbacher2009; @yau2009]. By 2012 it was famously promoted by *Harvard Business Review* when it dubbed data scientist the "sexiest job of the 21st century" [@davenport2012]. In this sector the usage became wildly popular, achieving buzzword status and prompting a high demand for data scientists in industry as well as for authoritative explanations of the nature of the role. This in turn motivated the formation of numerous academic degree programs in the US. It also elicited a strong reaction from academic statisticians alarmed by the perceived disconnect between data science and their own field [@davidian2013].

The statistical usage of data science began in Japan in the early 1990s among academic statisticians concerned with the threats and opportunities associated with computational statistics, data mining, and other developments relating to the rise of available computing and surplus data. Chikio Hayashi appears to have coined this usage in 1992[@ohsumi2002]; it was used by his student Noboru Ohsumi in 1994 and by 1996 the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) adopted it as part of a conference title [@ohsumi1994; @hayashi1998a]. This began a long engagement between the IFCS and data science that continues to this day in Europe and Japan. A parallel but shorter-lived variant of this usage emerged in the US between 1996 and 2001 when a small group of academic statisticians unsuccessfully exhorted their field to brand itself as data science and embrace new developments in computational statistics and machine learning [@kettenring1997a; @wu1997a; @cleveland2001]. A third variant of this usage was developed by traditional statisticians who viewed the rise of second-wave classical data science as a threat to their field, prompting calls to "own" data science[@rodriguez2012; @davidian2013; @yu2014; @asastat2015; @donoho2017].

These origins shed light on the specific characteristics of each tradition and why they sometimes are at odds with each other over fundamental questions.

The classical usage was motivated by an historically unique assemblage of networked data-generating and computational machinery that characterized post-war military and scientific endeavors that has only grown since that time. The primary problem faced in this context is what we can call *data impedance*---the endemic disproportion between the production of data by signal-generating instruments---from satellites and particle accelerators to, nowadays, smart phones and credit cards---capturing a wide range of natural and behavioral phenomena, and the ability to process and interpret these data, often rapidly, by means of computational machinery. In this context, data science emerged as an eclectic form of expertise associated with the pipeline of activities that begins with the acquisition of data, often from non-experimental sources, to its reduction and modeling, to its visualization and interpretation. In the early days, classical data science was heavily invested in pushing the envelope of computational technology to handle the demands of data impedance, leading to advances in the design of chips, networks, and databases. Indeed, the Internet connects directly the first and second variants of classical data science. The skills and values associated with this pipeline have been remarkably consistent from the 1960s to the present time---for example the desire and ability to work with very large sets of unstructured data, the focus on computational methods in place of analytic ones, and the premium placed on the visualization and communication of results to drive decision-making.

By contrast, the statistical usage developed in the context of an established academic field reacting to external developments---the technological developments within which classical data science emerged. Each of the three variants of the statistical usage was motivated by the perceived threats and opportunities opened by computational methods and the growing surplus of data being captured by databases and shared over networks. A recurrent theme in this usage is an attraction to machine learning methods, developed primarily by computer scientists, and a repulsion to data mining, perceived as an unprincipled collection of methods lacking in experimental design and mathematical grounding. In this context, data science emerged as a new form of statistics that would encompass and enhance the good parts of new computational methods while throwing away the bad.

<!--# Although the classical usage of data science has both historical and structural priority over the statistical, within the academy the statistical usage is dominant. This is because classical data science has had, until quite recently, no academic roots, whereas statistics is well established in the academy, where it has long provided the natural, social, and applied sciences a lingua franca of the scientific method. When around 2013 the academy stepped in to meet the demands of workforce development prompted the by second-wave classical data science, and related initiatives coming from fourth-paradigm e-science â€¦ -->
