# The 1990s: Statistical Data Science

Interestingly, in 1977 a prefixed variant of the term appeared in the
title of the technical report, "Non-Parametric Statistical Data Science:
A Unified Approach Based on Density Estimation and Testing for 'White
Noise'" [@parzen1977]. However, Parzen later published a version of this
work as "Nonparametric Statistical Data Modeling" [@parzen1979], which
indicates that his original word choice was mistaken. Yet the original
choice may not have been entirely unmotivated: Parzen's work attempted
to unify parametric and non-parametric methods under one umbrella. Given
the natural inclination of mathematical statistics for the former and
data analysis for the latter, his choice of the term data science may
have signaled an attempt to encompass both approaches to data. It is
also worth noting that he later used to the term to introduce a "new
culture of statistical science called LP MIXED DATA SCIENCE"
[@parzen2013], after the term became popular.[^04-history-1990s-1]
Whether or not this unifying goal was his motivation, statisticians
later became quite interested in the term for precisely this reason.

[^04-history-1990s-1]: Parzen's use of the term "culture" here echoes
    his comments on Breiman's famous essay on two cultures of
    statistical models, where he suggested that there are in fact
    several cultures, including his own, to which he devoted the
    majority of his response (Breiman 2001: 224--226).

## 1994: The Tokyo School

### Ohsumi and Meta-Stat

In the early 1990s, the term resurfaced in the context of statistics. It
appeared in the title of a 1994 essay by the Japanese statistician
Noburu Ohsumi on the application of hypermedia to the problem of
organizing data, "New Data and New Tools: A Hypermedia Environment for
Navigating Statistical Knowledge in Data Science," an elaboration of an
essay published two years earlier [@ohsumi1992;
@ohsumi1994].[^04-history-1990s-2] In these essays, Ohsumi described the
by now familiar litany of problems associated with data impedance,
although this time the focus was on the production of data resulting
from its analysis and storage, not its consumption in so-called raw
form:

[^04-history-1990s-2]: According to Ohsumi, "the term 'data science'
    appeared for the first time" in 1992, at a research exchange meeting
    between French and Japanese data analysts (so-called) at Montpelier
    University II in France [@ohsumi2000: 331]. He also claims to have
    "argued the urgency of the need to grasp the concept 'data science'"
    in 1992 (329).

> In research organizations handling statistical information, the volume
> of stored information resources, including research results,
> materials, and software, is increasing to the point that conventional
> separate databases and information management systems have become
> insufficient to deal with the amount. Increasing diversification in
> the media used these days interferes with the rapid retrieval and use
> of the information needed by users. A new system that realizes a
> presentation environment based on new concepts is needed to inform
> potential users of the value and effectiveness of using the vast
> amount of diverse data [@ohsumi1992: 375].

For research facilities around the world, the products of classical data
science---the database and data processing software---had become a
sorcerer's apprentice, creating new problems with each solution.
Organizations were drowning in the data sets they produced or acquired,
the software used to process them, the print and digital libraries of
reports and articles resulting from their analyses, and a host of other
materials. The requirements, approach, and design goals of Ohsumi's
proposed system, the Meta-Stat Navigator, are strikingly similar to
those of a contemporary system designed to solve the information
problems of another scientific organization: Berners-Lee's World Wide
Web, famously developed at CERN in 1989 [@berners-lee2008]. Of course,
the latter quickly obviated Ohsumi's proposal and become synonymous with
the Internet, invented decades earlier.

The significance of Meta-Stat for our purposes is that this kind of work
was understood clearly as data science at this point in history. Data
science continued to be connected with the processing and representation
of data, and was distinct from data analysis, but with this important
development: statisticians had become embedded in these technologies,
and their work had changed significantly as a result. And, as a result
of this change in working conditions, the connection between data
analysis and data science became closer.

Here we may locate with some precision a crucial transformation in the
meaning of the term, associated with its adoption by a new set of users.
One clue to this change is the opportunity Ohsumi observed amid the
challenges posed by data deluge:

> ... the information handled by the statistical sciences lies on the
> boundaries of various other sciences and clarifies the relationships
> and nature of information that joins these sciences. Development of a
> system that fully organizes and integrates strategic information is
> essential [@ohsumi1992: 375].

The Meta-Stat "system" was designed to realize the opportunity opened up
by the central position statisticians had come to occupy among the
prolifically data-generating sciences and the computational environment
in which these data were made available. Data science, in this view, is
*meta-statistics*, an encompassing concern for understanding data,
understood as a universal medium, and its relationship to knowledge.

This perspective was shared by Ohsumi's senior compatriot and fellow
statistician, Chikio Hayashi, whom Ohsumi described as "the pioneer and
founder of data science" [@ohsumi2004: 1].[^04-history-1990s-3]

[^04-history-1990s-3]: In his eulogy for Professor Hayashi, Ohsumi
    explained in some detail the motivation for his mentor's first usage
    of data science:

    > In the last ten years of his life, Professor Hayashi asserted the
    > importance of "data science as a theory of scientific methods."
    > The starting point was the meaning of the words "data science;"
    > this arose in 1992, when the professor was discussing the titles
    > and introductions of a collection of papers to be published at the
    > 2nd Japanese-French Scientific Seminar. *The professor used a
    > Japanese phrase that translates as "data science" and for the rest
    > of his life explored the concept behind this phrase.* When the
    > papers at the seminar were published, it was proposed for the
    > first time that the term referring to quantification be
    > standardized as "quantification method" and the subsequent English
    > terms were standardized as such. I can recall the professor
    > reprimanding us with the words "you are talking about different
    > concepts" when we referred to "deta kagaku" while another group
    > called it "deta no kagaku" (data science).
    >
    > The basis of data science is an extremely straightforward concept;
    > the fact that it needed to be expressed is an indication of the
    > chaos that exists today in statistical data analysis and the
    > deteriorating research environment. I am certain that the
    > professor had intended to lead the way in achieving a breakthrough
    > on these problems [@ohsumi2002: 5; emphasis added].

    #### 

### Hayashi's Usage

#### 1993

In 1993, at a round table discussion during the fourth conference of the
International Federation of Classification Societies held in Paris
(IFCS-93), Hayashi uttered the phrase "Data Science" and was then asked
to explain it. At the next conference (IFCS-96), he presented an answer,
in addition to having the conference named to emphasize the importance
of the term---"Data Science, Classification, and Related Methods." His
definition is as follows:

> Data science is not only a synthetic concept to unify \[mathematical\]
> statistics, data analysis and their related methods but also comprises
> their results. It includes three phases, design for data, collection
> of data, and analysis on data. Data science intends to analyze and
> understand actual phenomena with "data." In other words, the aim of
> data science is to reveal the features of the hidden structure of
> complicated natural, human and social phenomena with data from a
> different point of view from the established or traditional theory and
> method. This point of view implies multidimensional, dynamic and
> flexible ways of thinking [@hayashi1998: 41].

Hayashi went on to describe the sequence of design, collection, and
analysis as a primary and iterative "structure finding" process in which
data are transformed from a state of "diversification," given the
inherent "multifariousness" of the phenomena they represent, to one of
"conceptualization or simplification" (41). The discovery of structure
is accomplished with what we would recognize today as the methods of
exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning. In effect,
Hayashi's definition abstracted the design goals of Ohsumi's Meta-Stat
system and presented them as "a new paradigm" of science, one that would
encompass statistics, data analysis, and their vast output of data
within in a unified, process-oriented framework---data science (40).

In addition to Hayashi's own definition, it helpful also to see how the
field was defined by the editors (who included Hayashi) of the
proceedings of IFCS-96:

> The volume covers a wide range of topics and perspectives in *the
> growing field of data science*, including theoretical and
> methodological advances in domains relating to data gathering,
> classification and clustering, exploratory and multivariate data
> analysis, and knowledge discovery and seeking.
>
> It gives a broad view of the state of the art and is intended for
> those in the scientific community who either develop new data analysis
> methods or gather data and use search tools for analyzing and
> interpreting large and complex data sets. Presenting a wide field of
> applications, this book is of interest not only to data analysts,
> mathematicians, and statisticians but also to scientists from many
> areas and disciplines concerned with complex data: medicine, biology,
> space science, geoscience, environmental science, information science,
> image and pattern analysis, economics, statistics, social sciences,
> psychology, cognitive science, behavioral science, marketing and
> survey research, data mining, and knowledge organization
> [@hayashi1998a: v; emphasis added].

Of interest here is use of "data science" as a big tent, an inclusive
rubric under which to group a series of domains (which match roughly to
a process) as well as a broad range of disciplines and levels, from tool
builders to scientists and practice to theory. This passage is also
significant for including within the scope of data science the methods
of machine learning as well as data mining among the list of sciences
concerned with "complex data," suggesting the prominence of these
approaches at that time. We will see that not all definitions proceeding
from this community were as inclusive.

::: bourdieu
Hayashi assigned a revolutionary and almost messianic role to data
science. In his vision, the statistical sciences had lost their way.
Mathematical statisticians had come to overvalue abstract inference and
precision, and by choosing to work with the artificial data required to
pursue these goals were "prone to be removed from reality" (40). Data
analysts, although working with real data, had "come to manipulate or
handle only existing data without taking into consideration both the
quality of data and the meaning of data ... to make efforts only for the
refinement of convenient and serviceable computer software and to
imitate popular ideas of mathematical statistics without considering the
essential meaning" (40). As a result of these divergent attitudes toward
data, and the disregard of both for the scientist's engagement with the
primary, existential relationship between data and phenomena, the field
had become stagnant and lacking in innovation. Data science emerged as a
savior, unifying a divided people, showing their way out of the
wilderness, and restoring prosperity and prestige to their community.

If Hayashi's criticisms of data analysis sound familiar to those leveled
today against data scientists, it is because the issues data science was
meant to resolve are recurring and systemic. So too is the separation
between data analysis and mathematical statistics, which was recognized
by Box, and later Tukey, in the 1970s. In his response to Parzen---who,
we noted, sought to overcome a methodological split between the two
subfields---Tukey wrote:

> I concur with the general sentiments expressed by George Box in his
> Presidential Address ... that we have great need for the whole
> statistician in one body---for the analyst of data as well as for the
> probability model maker---and the inferential theorist/practitioner.
> One cannot, however, make a whole man by claiming that one can subsume
> one important class of mental activity under another class whose style
> and purposes are not only different but incompatible. To be "whole
> statisticians" as Box might put it, or to be "whole statistician-data
> analysts" as I might, means to be single persons who can take quite
> different views and adopt quite different styles as the needs change.
> As the title of my paper of yesterday put it, "we need both
> exploratory and confirmatory"! The twain can---and should---meet, but
> they need to remain a pair (or two distinct parts of a larger team) if
> they are to do what they should and can [@tukey1979: 122].

Tukey implies a solution to the schism, later observed by Hayashi, in
better organization, not in a utopian "new man" or in a synthetic
science *per se*, recalling the division of labor proposed by Naur, but
here focusing on different roles within that division. Implicit in this
approach is the view that the problem with statistics was not epistemic
but organizational.

Here it is helpful to recall a property of Kuhn's concept of
paradigm---an obvious lens through which to observe our topic---which is
often overlooked by those who use the term: it refers no to an abstract
body of ideas that succeed on the basis of their intrinsic rationality
or truth value, but to the successful practical application of ideas by
means of novel methods and tools in a way that they may be imitated. The
concept has both epistemic and social dimensions. Viewed in this light,
the question of whether data science is in fact a science---our main
question---becomes a matter of determining whether it solves important
problems in new ways, by means of an assemblage of ideas, methods, and
tools that may be grasped and imitated by others. Hence, although Tukey
and Hayashi may appear to be divergent in their approaches to overcoming
the problems, they represent the two aspects of a scientific paradigm,
the one conceptual, the other practical. This should not be viewed as
contradictory.

### A Canary the has Forgotten to Sing

Following the IFCS meetings, as well as two meetings of the Japan
Statistical Society that held "special sessions on data science,''
Ohsumi developed Hayashi's definition as well as its rationale
[@ohsumi2000: 331]. We call this the Tokyo school of data science, given
the association of both Hayashi and Ohsumi with the Institute of
Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo, Japan. In a paper that explicitly
addressed the relationship between data analysis and data science, and
which is perhaps the first of several to claim the flag of data science
for statistics, Ohsumi declared that because of its privileging
of"mathematical methodologies" over an engagement with data acquisition,
data analysis had become "a canary that has forgotten to sing,"
referring to a Japanese children's song that contemplates a silent
bird's fate (332).[^04-history-1990s-4] Amplifying Hayashi, he asserted
that "\[h\]ow data are gathered is the key to defining the relevant
information and making it easy to understand and analyze" (331). In
making this point, Ohsumi referred to a new figure on the scene, one
that contradicted the principles he proposed:

[^04-history-1990s-4]: The specific reference is to a poem, later set to
    music, written by the Japanese poet Saijoo Yaso (西条八十), who
    lived from 1892 to 1970. According to Miriam Davis, "The moral of
    the song is that if the canary loses its song it is not worth its
    existence so it should make the most of the gift of song it has been
    given." [@davis]

> In my opinion, this viewpoint on the meaning of data science is
> fundamentally different from data mining (DM) and knowledge discovery
> (KD). These concepts are not of practical use because they neglect the
> problems of "data acquisition" and its practice (332).

It is significant that Ohsumi excludes these new fields---or field,
since the two so frequently co-occur, along with the variant KDD,
"knowledge discovery in databases"---from his definition of data
science, since many today would consider the two synonymous.

## Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery

The paradox is instructive: the name "data mining," as used here, made
its appearance in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a rubric that
included a set of practices motivated by precisely the same conditions
that led the Tokyo school to propose the field of data science in the
first place. Among these conditions was the relatively sudden appearance
of vast amounts of data stored in databases---one of the fruits of
classical data science---owing to the rise of relational databases and
personal computing in the 1980s, and a suite of tools to work with data,
from spreadsheets to programming languages to statistical software
packages. Whereas many statisticians viewed these developments with
alarm, being acutely aware of the epistemic disruptions they produced
for the received workflow of data analysis, the data mining community
embraced them as an opportunity to convert data into value. Coming
mainly from the field of computer science, data miners developed a set
of methods that included the application of machine learning algorithms
to the data found in databases in various contexts, from science to
industry (such as point-of-sale records generated as by-product of
computerized cash registers and credit card use). The relationship
between machine learning and data mining was also mutually
beneficial---data miners supplied machine learning projects with the
large sets of data required for this class of algorithms to perform
well. This relationship was greatly reinforced with the rise and
development of the Web and social media platforms, which generated
enormous amounts of behavioral data.

Although the two fields---for simplicity, let's call them data analysis
and data mining---were responding to the same conditions of data surplus
and impedance, their philosophical orientations could not have been more
opposed. This difference is clearest in their respective evaluations of
data *provenance*, the source and conditions under which data are
produced. For the data miner, data provenance is largely irrelevant to
the possibility of converting data into value. Data are data, regardless
of how they are generated, and the same methods may be applied to them
regardless of source, so long as their structure is understood. Indeed,
for the data miner data exists much as natural resources do, as a given
part of the environment, which helps explain the success of the metaphor
of *mining* over competing variants, such as *harvesting*, which implies
intentional creation. For the data analyst, as Hayashi and Ohsumi took
such pains to emphasize, provenance is, or should be, everything,
echoing the statistician's orthodox preference for experimental over
observational data.

This difference was expressed by Ohsumi in his definition of data
science in opposition to data mining:

> Owing to the qualitative and quantitative changes in data \[produced
> by the conditions described above\], it is, indeed, becoming
> increasingly difficulty to grasp all aspects of a dataset in
> explaining various phenomena. Therefore, new techniques, such as DM,
> KD, complexity, and neural networks, are being proposed. However, the
> potential of these methods to solve any of these problems is
> questionable (332).

Ohsumi went on to characterize the way data has changed by listing the
new kinds of data with which the statistician is confronted. These
include prominently data sets found in databases as by-products of
various processes, such as passive accumulation (e.g. from point-of-sale
devices), unstructured data (included in text fields), and aggregated
data generated "spontaneously and accumulating automatically in the
electronic data collection environment" (332-333). He explained his
concern with data mining:

> When it comes to analyzing these datasets, people discuss DM and
> related techniques. However, the important questions to answer are:
> what dataset is necessary to explicate a certain phenomenon, why is it
> necessary, how to design its acquisition, and how difficult the whole
> process is. *This is more important than the dataset itself*. Books on
> DM do contain terms such as "data preparation", "getting the data",
> "sampling procedures", and "data auditing", but there is an assumption
> that the dataset is given and the procedure may start with analysis.
> Fiddling with a dataset once it is collected is merely a
> self-contained play of data handling [@ohsumi2000: 333; emphasis
> added].

Although his evaluation of data mining seems to be woefully off base---a
great deal of Google's success, to take one example, was founded on
their embrace of data mining at the time of Ohsumi's essay---in fact his
concern is not with the success of predictive analytics *per se*, but
with solving what he considered to be the central problem of data
science, that of understanding how data are generated in the first
place. Given some of the issues that classifiers have encountered with
respect to racial bias, for example, he cannot be said to have been
wrong.

### Narrative

In the January 1999 issue of the *IFCS Newsletter*, the Japanese
Classification Society (JCS) reports that "a special seminar about 'Data
mining in Data Science' will be held at March 1999" at the JCS Annual
Meeting [@deboeck1999: 2].

Hayashi, then president of the IFCS, wrote in the Sept 1999 Newsletter
column "From the President":

> The potential energy of the IFCS is increasing over the years, and it
> keeps increasing since the last conference. We can say with firm
> confidence that the results of data science (including statistics,
> data analysis, classification and related methods in different
> respects) really contribute to the development of science and more in
> general to our civilization and global environment.
>
> Further, I expect that new approaches, and new methodologies and
> methods in data science will be developed for the coming 21st century,
> and that the presentations of IFCS meetings will reflect these new
> ideas. I believe that signs of new movements will be found in the
> Namur conference in 2000.

## Tanaka and the JSCS

-   JSCS est 1986

Tanaka describes the role of editor of the JJSCS between 1986 and 1990:

> The major purpose of establishing JSCS was to make a progress in
> computational statistics in Japan by providing a forum for people
> working in various aspects of computational statistics, e.g.,
> *statisticians* engaged in the research and application of statistical
> theory and methods, *computer scientists/engineers* engaged in the
> development of statistical software, and *statisticians/data analysts*
> engaged in the analysis of data obtained with surveys, experiments or
> other means, and provide them opportunities for exchanging information
> and ideas and, if possible, for finding seeds for joint works among
> them (75; emphases added).

Tanaka points out that the term is not new:

> By the way, the opportunities to meet the term "Data Science"
> increased rapidly in recent years, but, it was not a new term for
> statisticians. It was used at the 2nd Japanese-French Scientific
> Seminar (organized by Yves Escoufier, Chikio Hayashi, and others) held
> in Montpellier. The title of the Seminar and the Proceedings published
> later by Academic Press in 1995 was "Data Science and Its
> Applications". This term was used for "new science with data at its
> core". The meaning is essentially the same to that currently used,
> though types of data to be analyzed have changed in a quarter century
> (76).

## 1997: The US

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of papers and presentations
by academic statisticians in the US echoed the theme of malaise
expressed by the Tokyo school: the field of statistics was suffering
from an image problem and needed to redefine itself in order to meet the
challenges of a variety of existential threats. These threats included
the rise of computational methods and large amounts of data, the
emergence of non-traditional predictive methods and areas of research,
such as data mining, that were taking the limelight from statistics, and
an unflattering public image. Interestingly, given the lack of reference
to the Tokyo school in these sources, many of the proposed responses
included expanding the scope of statistics to encompass these new
methods and to rebrand the field as "data science." Frequently
associated with this suggestion was a concern for updating university
curricula for teaching statistics and, apparently for the first time,
the creation of a new kind of statistician, the "data
scientist"---recalling the mythical figure of the "whole statistician"
discussed by Tukey in the 1970s. In these exhortations to the community
of statisticians, the data scientist emerged as the "new man" of a
reborn statistical science, one that who would overcome the field's
crisis of recognition.

The first of these exhortations appears to have come from Jon R.
Kettenring in his Presidential Address to the American Statistical
Association on 12 August 1997, where he expressed concern for image of
statistics:

> Looking ahead, image reconstruction must be one of our top priorities.
> It must be understood that *statistics is the data science of the 21st
> century*---essential for the proper running of government, central to
> decision making in industry, and a core component of modern curricula
> at all levels of education. I would like to see ASA make image
> reconstruction a part of its strategic plan. And I suspect we may need
> some professional help if we are to succeed
> [@89618ac5-1e4e-3cce-a5de-eb7b926f27c9: 1230, emphasis added].

In this talk, Kettenring clearly expressed the ambivalence of the
statistics community toward the rise of computational methods that we
saw in the Tokyo school. On one hand, computer science was welcomed and
it's contributions were viewed as opportunities:

> I believe the time has come for us to acknowledge that computer
> science needs to take its place alongside mathematics (and
> probability) as fundamental linch pins of statistics and as
> disciplines that undergird our research and instruction. Examples of
> relevant topics in computer (and computing) science include databases
> and database management, algorithm design, computational statistics,
> artificial intelligence and machine learning
> [@89618ac5-1e4e-3cce-a5de-eb7b926f27c9: 1232].

On the other hand, data mining---the most notable development coming
from the computational field---was excluded from this vision. Not only
was it absent from the list of relevant topics above, it was singled out
for criticism, echoing the stance of the Tokyo school. In highlighting
software development and data mining as "two opportunities that sit at
the intersection of computer science and statistics," Kettenring wrote:

As an aside, it is worth noting that Friedman in the keynote referenced
above, expressed the same ambivalence toward data mining. It is at once
lauded as "having a major impact in business, industry, and science"
affording "enormous research opportunities for new methodological
developments" and derided as a "device to sell computer hardware and
software" [@friedman1997].

Kettenring's message was echoed three months later by the academic
statistician C. F. Jeff Wu in a lecture delivered at the University of
Michigan entitled "Statistics = Data Science?" [@wu1997]. Note that
although Wu was not the first to suggest that statistics be renamed to,
and redefined as, data science, he is often regarded as the first in the
US to do so [@donoho2017]. Regarding image, Wu pointed out that
statisticians were perceived as either accountants or involved with
simple descriptive statistics---and prone to lying with these
statistics, as the saying goes---when in fact their work comprised
everything from data collection to modeling and analysis to solving
problems and making decisions. As a remedy, he implored his colleagues
to "think big" and embrace the changes and challenges that we have seen
already---the rise of large and complex data sets, the use of neural
networks and data mining methods, and the emergence of new fields such
as computer vision. In addition to suggesting a name change for the
field, he appears to have been the first to suggest a name change of the
role of statistician to data scientist, along with a college curriculum
to that would embrace all phases of data science and be profoundly
interdisciplinary.

Wu's proposal is stronger than Kettenring's. Kettenring, whose language
suggests that he was aware of the prior existence of data science as a
field, believed that statistics should embrace and encompass data
science as the rightful heir to its fruits and labors. In contrast, Wu
asserted that statistics should expand its scope and rename itself "data
science," because it "is likely the remaining good name reserved for us"
[@wu1997a: slide 12]. In both cases, however, the usage of the term data
science included much of computer science, which is consistent with the
classical definition that developed in the 1960s and '70s.

Practical plans for revamped curricula to train this new kind of
statistician---the data scientist---appear after these appeals. The most
well-known is found in Cleveland's essay, "Data Science: An Action Plan
for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics"
[@cleveland2001], even though he used the term "data analyst" as his
target student. Consistent with previous definitions of data science as
statistics augmented by computational methods and tools, he proposed a
curriculum comprising six areas, along with percentages denoting the
amount of time and resources that should be devoted to each:
Multidisciplinary Investigations (25%), Models and Method for Data
(20%), Computing with Data (15%), Pedagogy (15%), Tool Evaluation (5%),
and Theory (20%). This distribution is more or less consistent with the
definitions we have seen proposed by other statisticians, including the
Tokyo school. As a measure of how radical this suggestion was, consider
Donoho's remarks, made over a decade and a half later:

> Several academic statistics departments that I know well could, at the
> time of Cleveland's publication, fit 100% of their activity into the
> 20% Cleveland allowed for theory. Cleveland's article was republished
> in 2014. I cannot think of an academic department that devotes today
> 15% of its effort on pedagogy, or 15% on computing with data. I can
> think of several academic statistics departments that continue to fit
> essentially all their activity into the last category, theory
> [@donoho2017: 750].

Radical as it may have appeared, the curriculum was fairly conservative.
The area of "models and methods," for example, focused exclusively on
statistical data models, as opposed to algorithmic ones (to use
Breiman's terms, discussed below), while the "computing with data" area
focused narrowly on the infrastructure to support these models.
Cleveland's bias toward traditional statistical modeling is made clear
in his explanation of it:

> The data analyst faces two critical tasks that employ statistical
> models and methods: (1) specification---the building of a model for
> the data; (2) estimation and distribution---formal,
> mathematical-probabilistic inferences, conditional on the model, in
> which quantities of a model are estimated, and uncertainty is
> characterized by probability distributions [@cleveland2001: 22].

That the one is subordinate to the other is evident in Cleveland's
remark: "A collection of models and methods for data analysis will be
used only if the collection is implemented in a computing environment
that makes the models and methods sufficiently efficient to use" (23).
He did make a passing reference to algorithmic models, but his example
came from their use to support stochastic modeling:

> Historically, the field of data science has concerned itself only with
> one corner of this large domain \[i.e. computing with
> data\]---computational algorithms. Here, even though effort has been
> small compared with that for other areas, the impact has been large.
> One example is Bayesian methods, where breakthroughs in computational
> methods took a promising intellectual current and turned it into a
> highly practical, widely used general approach to statistical
> inference (23).

If it is not made clear from this passage that he did not have the wider
field of data mining and knowledge discovery in mind, the following
passage does:

> Computer scientists, waking up to the value of the information stored,
> processed, and transmitted by today's computing environments, have
> attempted to fill the void. Once current of work is data mining. *But
> the benefit to the data analyst has been limited, because knowledge
> among computer scientists about how to think of and approach the
> analysis of data is limited*, just as the knowledge of computing
> environments by statisticians is limited (23; emphasis added).

So, Cleveland continued the practice of the Tokyo school to put at arms
length the contributions of data miners, for their lack of training in
traditional statistics or their lack of attention to data design, and to
confine the role of computational expertise to knowledge of
"environments."

::: bourdieu
Regarding the argument being made here, that the term "data science" has
been in continuous circulation since the 1960s, and not independently
coined in various contexts, Cleveland's remarks, similar to those of
Kettenring, indicate that the term was already known to statisticians,
even as they sought to appropriate it for their own purposes. The
sentence---"Historically, the field of data science has concerned itself
only with one corner of this large domain ..."---indicates awareness of
prior usage, as well as a definition that aligns with what we have
called classical data science. In any case, as we have seen, CODATA,
representing classical data science, began publishing the *Data Science
Journal* in 2001, the time of Cleveland's proposal.
:::

The task of educating data scientists was also addressed at this time at
a workshop sponsored by the American Statistical Association in 2000 on
the topic of undergraduate education in statistics. In a report of the
proceedings published in the *American Statistician*, the following
understanding of data science was expressed:

> ... what is needed is a broader conception of statistics, a conception
> that includes data management and computer skills that assist in
> managing, exploring, and describing data. The terms "data scientist"
> or "data specialist" were suggested as perhaps more accurate
> descriptions of what should be desired in an undergraduate statistics
> degree. Data specialists would be concerned with the "front end" of a
> data analysis project: designing and managing data collection,
> designing and managing databases, manipulating and transforming data,
> performing exploratory and "basic" analysis [@higgins1999]. Data
> scientists (or specialists) a might share some course work with
> computer science majors, but where a computer scientist studies
> compilers and assembly language, a data scientist studies data
> analysis and statistics [@bryce2001: 12; citation in original].

The reference to Higgins is from a paper where he asserted the need for
statisticians to pay more attention to "the non-mathematical part of
statistics," so that undergraduate programs may respond to the
"explosion in the amount of data available to society" [@higgins1999:
1]. In this area he included "designing scientific studies in a
team-oriented environment, ensuring protocol compliance, ensuring data
quality, managing the storage/transmission/retrieval of data, and
providing descriptive and graphical analyses of data" (1). Here, again,
we see a definition of data science as an improved version of
statistics, in response to the persistent condition of data impedance,
that would include data management and computing skills (and data
design)---but not the methods of data mining. Consistent with the
implied structural relationship between statistics and data science,
data science was sometimes described as a part of statistics. Tellingly,
both Bryce, et al., and Higgins equivocated on the use of data
scientist, and suggested "data specialist" as an alternate name, perhaps
so as not to overshadow the role of the data analyst. In any case, the
choice of term was motivated by marketing; as Higgins wrote:

> Guttman expressed the opinion that the term statistics carries such a
> negative connotation that it might be wise to rename our departments
> something like "Department of Data Science" or "Department of
> Information and Data Science." In this vein, I have suggested the term
> "data specialist" [@higgins1999].[^04-history-1990s-5]

    found in a paper by Kettenring (Kettenring 1997a).
