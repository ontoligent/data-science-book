# On Language

There is no more basic fact of human behavior than its sensitivity to language.

The way humans classify the world largely determines how they will behave within it, and classification is primarly achieved through language. Language is a classification system.

Consider the following examples.

Language not only orients human behavior, it orients human organization. 

Students of the natural sciences tend to miss this. They are used to directly engaging with the world; language for them is an instrument, a means to an end, a form of whay Polanyi called tacit knowledge. But language not lightly overlay the world as a convenient way of describing and sharing information about the world. It shapes thinking and makes possible the creation of knowledge. Because all knowledge is social. 

But the humanist and social scientist cannot help but notice the profound effect on language and human behavior, science included.
