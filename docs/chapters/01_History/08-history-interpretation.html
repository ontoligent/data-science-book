<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="themes"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Themes</h2>
<p>Let us stop here, roughly at the point where data science becomes widely known and legitimate in the eyes of industry, and both accepted and contested within academia, and which characterizes the current period. What can we glean from this historical outline? Several themes emerge. Most significantly, it has been established that the term data science per se dates back to the early 1960s with the formation of the Data Sciences Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and this usage was surprisingly close to its current one. To review, the esseential elements were there: the presence of big data (properly understood) and the use of both computational machinery and artificial intelligence to make sense of it. Morevoer, this original meaning remains surprisingly consistent in the decades that follow, even as the term developed and accreted new senses. This development can be characterized as having three main phases resulting in three major variant definitions of the term: (1) Computational Data Science, (2) Statistical Data Science, and (3) Big Data Science. In addition, we can add a fourth definition, inchoate and currently being developed, that we may call Academic Data Science. These are described below.</p>
</section>
<section id="four-definitions" class="level2" data-number="7.3">

<section id="ds1-computational-data-science" class="level3" data-number="7.3.1">
<h3 data-number="7.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ds1-computational-data-science"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> DS<sub>1</sub>: Computational Data Science</h3>
<p>This is the original, or classical, definition of data science that begins with the Data Sciences Laboratory and is taken up, at first in spirit if not in name, by organizations like CODATA during the same era. Data science in this definition is <em>the science of data in support of science and decision-making</em>. This definition also includes the concept of datalogy developed by Naur as well as the data processing know-how of corporations like Mohawk Data Science, but it is primarily a field developed by and for scientists and engineers to handle the problems arising from data surplus, culminating in the so-called fourth paradigm of science. That this field by this name persists and becomes established through the current era is evident in the fact that the term “data scientist” had currency in places like <em>New Scientist</em>, <em>TheTimes</em> of London, and other news sources in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition, data science in this sense is the subject of high level reports from the NSF and JISC in the 2000s. That this definition persists to this day can be found in examples like the work of the Dutch data scientist Demchenko, who assigns data management, curation, preservation central places in the definition of data science (Demchenko 2017).</p>
<p>Essential to this definition is a focus on what is eventually called big data and issues arising from its curation and processing. Importantly, this definition also frames data surplus as a positive condition that makes possible new ways doing science, i.e.&nbsp;the fourth paradigm view of sicence. Methodologically, this definition also embraces AI, machine learning, and data mining methods that may or may not be principled from a strict statistical point of view. It also embraces statistical methods, but from the practical perspective of scientists are who often not concerned with the concerns of pure, mathematical statisticians.</p>
<p>Arguably this definition also includes adjacent work in computer science of data processing, information retrieval, and information science which led to the invention and development of databases and general theories of data. Eventually, the fruits of this work would lead to the conditions of data impedance that led to data mining, a practice that converted the vice of surplus into a virtue by establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between surplus digital data and machine learning.</p>

<section id="ds2-statistical-data-science" class="level3" data-number="7.3.2">
<h3 data-number="7.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ds2-statistical-data-science"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> DS<sub>2</sub>: Statistical Data Science</h3>
<p>By statistical data science, I refer to the usage developed by Hayashi and Ohsumi (the Tokyo School) and the American statisticians Wu, Kettenring, and Cleveland, as well as Donoho. These statisticians implored their colleagues, unsuccessfully, to adopt the term data science in order to rebrand their discipline in response to the overshadowing effects of computational statistics and data mining that were being felt in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The essential characteristics of this definition are the renewed commitment to Tukey’s conception of data analysis and, more generally, an appreciation of the foundational role of data in statistics, along with an exhortation to take seriously recent developments in computer science in areas ranging from machine learning to databases. However, these technologies are to be incorporated with the admonition to avoid the practices of data mining, which, on its own, is considered unprincipled. Indeed, this definition may be seen primarily as an effort to correct what are perceived to be the fruitful but misguided efforts of data mining by grounding its computational methods in a mathematically sound framework.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding the relationship of data science to the computational technologies on which it depends, this definition treats them as essential but external to core practice. Languages, servers, and databases are thought of as an environment within which the analyst carries out an essentially mathematical set of tasks with greater efficiency, not as the medium through which one thinks about the world. Their net effect on the work of statistics is considered to be a difference in degree, not in kind.</p>

<section id="ds3-big-data-science" class="level3" data-number="7.3.3">
<h3 data-number="7.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ds3-big-data-science"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> DS<sub>3</sub>: Big Data Science</h3>
<p>By big data science, I refer to the form of data science that emerged in the context of web companies like Google and Facebook and become both viral and paradigmatic after being anointed by <em>HBR</em> in 2012. As we have seen, this definition transfers the classical, computational definition, developed within the military-industrial context of the 1960s, to the context of the Silicon Valley social media firm, or what Zuboff has called surveillance capitalism. The conditions of data impedance that attended the rise of Big Science after WWII are embraced and become the foundation of a new business model that in turn becomes a model for all other firms and sectors to imitate, from the automotive industry to medicine.</p>
<p>One of the distinctive features of this definition is the close association with big data, in perception if not always in reality, as both a set of new technologies to manage 3D data and a set of “unreasonably effective” methods to convert these data into value. Another feature is the focus on data wrangling, the work required to convert the widely varying formats and conditions of data in the wild into the standard analytical form. In addition to these features, and consistent with Varian’s remarks in the 2008 McKinsey interview, big data science embraces a suite of activities that connect these practices to the context of business and decision-making, such as visualization, communication, business acumen, and a focus on marketable data products.</p>
<p>It follows that Donoho is incorrect in asserting that “[w]e can immediately reject ‘big data’ as a criterion for meaningful distinction between statistics and data science” (Donoho 2017: 747). The assemblage of computational technology associated with big data is the condition of possibility of data science in this definition, its <em>sine qua non</em>. It is impossible to imagine this kind of data science without the infrastructure of data generating machinery, high-performance computating architectures, scalable database technologies such as Hadoop and its descendants, and data-savvy programming languages such as R, Python, and Julia, and, to a high degree, the availability of extant datasets on the web. Indeed, the connection between this kind of data science and the technology stack on which it stands is so close that the relationship between technology and science becomes blurred, leading to revolutionary proclamantions of new kinds of science and conservative reactions to such claims (such as Donoho’s).</p>

<section id="ds4-academic-data-science" class="level3" data-number="7.3.4">
<h3 data-number="7.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ds4-academic-data-science"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.4</span> DS<sub>4</sub>: Academic Data Science</h3>
<p>By academic data science, I refer to the ongoing reception of big data science by the academic community in response to the demand for data scientists across all sectors of society. The idea of data science has influenced the academy in two ways: first, by stimulating the production of degree programs to meet workforce demands, and second, by providing a model for effective knowledge production in the context of pervasive data and data technologies. Both of these influences have given rise to the secondary effect of bringing to the surface and aggregating the myriad other forms of data-centric and analytic activities already being conducted in the academy (and elsewhere) for years, from statistics to operations research to e-sceince, all of which have claims to be “already doing data science.” This situation has led to current crisis in the definition of data science that is has produced responses such as Donoho’s as well as the current essay.</p>
<p>Based on personal experience, I believe that the term data science within the academy has in recent years been nudged in the direction of being identified with an expanded form of statistics (DS<sub>2</sub>), regardless of whether its programs are “owned” by departments of statistics or not.&nbsp;This is because of the great authority of the field of statistics within the academy, as well as a general skepticism toward industry-generated categories by academics, many of whom dismiss the terms big data and data science as buzzwords. This has put pressure on developers of data science programs to become academically legitimate in the eyes of their peers and administrators. The shift in meaning is also due, quite frankly, to the co-opting of the phrase by departments of statistics to both cash in on it’s name recognition and stem the tide of what are perceived to be its negative qualities. This tendendency has had the effect of flooding the market of data scientstis with de facto data analysts who are unable to perform the work that many in industry had previously sought under the sign of data scientist. And this has produced a counter-effect within industry to invent new categories of work, such as the data engineer and the data software developer. In reality, these new categories are surprisingly close in meaning to the original category of data-processing scientist that was coined in the 1950s in the context of data reduction and other work that eventually became associated with the AFCRL Data Sciences Laboratory and with scientific research data management in general.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate state of affairs. The great value of data science has been in its cultivation of the fertile land between the science and engineering of data opened up by the great advances in data generating and processing machinery for both science and industry. It is also unfortunate because as the academy produces a definition of data science at odds with what science and industry need, the latter are once again left to fend for themselves, creating their own ad hoc educational resources to convert computer scientists and other adjacent role into data engineers. A rose is a rose by another other name.</p>

<section id="data-impedance" class="level2" data-number="7.4">
<h2 data-number="7.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-impedance"><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Data Impedance</h2>
<p>To summarize, the field of data science has a surprisingly consistent and durable history, even if, on the ground, the individual actors in this social drama have not been not aware of this fact. The original constitution of the field, DS<sub>1,</sub> survives to the present day, providing the backbone and the foil for each of the following configurations. For if DS<sub>2</sub> is clearly a reaction to the effects of the first, DS<sub>3</sub> is a revival of DS<sub>1</sub> in a new key. Wu and Hammberbacher may not have been aware that they were borrowing a term from one context and applying it to another analogous one, but social facts are rarely perceived as such by the individuals who participate in them.</p>
<p>I hypothesize that the source of this continuity is a persistent situation in which it makes sense to use the term data science. The term is motivated in at least two ways. First, it is motivated semiotically by virtue of its complementary relationship to other extant categories which constitute the repertoire available concepts and terms. Data science is not computer science nor information science nor statistics nor data analysis but adjacent to each of these. In each case, the term was selected from the sample space of these other terms, which always remained possible choices. The fact that they were not selected is what is significant. Second, the term was and is motivated by the role that it plays in referencing a persistent assemblage of material conditions that emerged during the post war era and continues to this day. In addition to being embodied by the SAGE system that arguably motived the initial coinage of data science, those material conditions gave birth to the Internet, whose construction was first conceived shortly after 1957 in response to the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union, and to the field of data processing and everything associated with it, including the development of databases and the refining of the concept of data itself.</p>
<p>I have chosen the term data impedance to characterize this persistent situation. Again, by this term I mean the disproportion between the surplus of data generated by the machinery of data production, and the relative scarcity of computational power and methods to process these data and extract value from them. To be sure the condition of impedance has been part of the human condition since the formation of states which require the use of media to function. By media, I mean external records that must be stored and interpreted to be useful. Such records range from the quipus of the ancient Inca, to the hieroglyphic writing systems of the ancient Maya and Egyptians, to those of Asia and Europe. What is historically unique about the post-war condition of data impedance is that it occurs within the milieux of digital and electronic data characterized as the input and output of computational machinery. Although other forms of data are clearly part of the condition I am describing, these technologies are at the center and what gives the unique historical character to the condition I am describing and to data science.</p>

<p>A final theme one may observe in this history is that data science has been a contested term at least since the 1990s, when statistical data science (DS<sub>2</sub>) emerged in Japan and the US in response to the developments of classical, computational data science. As we have seen, this response was partly an attempt to embrace the advances made by computational data science (DS<sub>1</sub>) and partly an effort to correct what were perceived to be the excesses of this approach. The marginalization of computational technology in this definition of data science is consistent with the larger conflict between what Breiman famously called “two cultures” in the work of statistics.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Breiman’s trope provides a useful framework for capturing the epistemological differences between the two communities associated with these definitions. On the one hand, we have the data analysts, on the other the data miners. The former, descendants of Tukey, remained faithful to the mission of statistics to provide a mathematically principled methodology for working with data. Ideally, all data were understood to be produced by information generating mechanisms that can be described by interpretable models and, in the ideal case, parametrically. Even Bayesian methods, long held back by their complexity, but reborn with the rise of computational methods like MCMC and Gibbs Sampling, were reined in by the data modeler’s ethos. The latter, the data miners, unfettered by such requirements, enthusiastically applied the newer and rapidly developing world of algorithms and, more generally, computational thinking to the data surplus that was inundating science, government, and industry.</p>
<p>To conclude, an authentic definition of data science would embrace the term’s history. As we have seen, this history is not merely etymological; the term indexes a persistent situation that continues to motivate the current practice of data science in industry and science. Academics would do well to embrace this and avoid what may be called the fallacy of purism as we seek to make sense of the field as a body of knowledge. This means embracing the oppositions between data analysis and data mining, and between science and engineering, as a core, animating tensions in the field that may be cultivated for its generativity.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The works of Hastie, Tibshirini, and their coauthors are perhaps the most successful exemplars of this definition; their work incorporates enthusiastically data mining, but always within the encompassing framework of statistical thinking that effectively domesticates the field (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009; Efron and Hastie 2016).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>It is no coincidence that Breiman’s essay appeared at about the time some academic statisticians sought to rebrand their field as data science in an attempt to integrate the gains of computational technology while purging it of the methodological sins of data mining. Although Breiman is sometimes counted among those wishing to rebrand statistics as data science, the substance of his remarks, which did not reject the spirit of data mining, went against the grain of that movement.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
