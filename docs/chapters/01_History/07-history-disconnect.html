<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-disconnect-with-statistics"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> The Disconnect with Statistics</h2>
<p>Among the most significant developments in the years immediately following the emergence of what I have called big data science was the explicit perception by professional statisticians that all of this occurred independently of their field, and that statisticians would do well to take advantage of the new interest in data that was sweeping the business world. In a series of surprisingly candid editorials in <em>AmStatNews</em>—the membership magazine of the American Statistical Society—no fewer than three succeeding presidents of the organization, from 2012 to 2014, offered their views on what they saw as a troubling “disconnect” between the field of statistics and data science.</p>
<p>This disconnect—between the self-perception among statisticians that they already are data scientists and their exclusion from real developments in industry and the media under the name of big data—is captured by this anecdote given by Marie Davidian in her column (entitled “Aren’t We Data Scientists?”):</p>
<p>I was astonished to review the list of founding members [of the National Consortium for Data Science (NCDS) based in North Carolina] and see that not only is my university (North Carolina State) a founding member, but so are Duke University and UNC-CH. Along with SAS Institute; Research Triangle Institute International; NIH’s National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences; IBM; and several other institutions, businesses, and government agencies that employ numerous statisticians. The member representatives listed on the website from NC State, Duke, and UNC-CH are computer scientists/engineers, and among all 17 representatives, <em>there is not one statistician</em>. (Davidian 2013: 3; emphasis added.)</p>
<p>The gap was noted a year earlier by Robert Rodriguez, but without the surprise:</p>
<p>A recurring theme in Big Data stories is the scarcity of “data scientists”—the term used for people who can draw insights from large quantities of data. This shortage was highlighted in an April 26, 2012, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article titled, “Big Data’s Big Problem: Little Talent” (Rooney 2012). The question “What is a data scientist?” is still being debated (see the articles with this title at Forbes). However, <em>there is consensus that data scientists must be innovative problem solvers with expertise in statistical modeling and machine learning, specialized programming skills, and a solid grasp of the problem domain</em>. Hilary Mason, chief data scientist at bitly, adds that “<em>data scientists are responsible for effectively communicating the things that they learn. That might be creating visualizations or telling the story of the question, the answer, and the context</em>.” (Rodriguez 2012: 3-4; citation and emphases added.)</p>
<p>It is notable that Rodriguez clearly recognized the reality behind the disconnect, conceding that “our profession and the ASA have not been very involved in Big Data activities.” He did not trivialize the concepts of big data and data science; instead, he patiently explained their distinctive features and provided suggestions for how statisticians can add value to these developments going forward. He suggested that statisticians should “view data science as a blend of statistical, mathematical, and computational sciences,” and focus their efforts on how to “extract value from data not only by learning from it, but also by understanding its limitations and improving its quality. Better data matters because simply having Big Data does not guarantee reliable answers for Big Questions.”</p>
<p>In a subsequent editorial co-authored with the two succeding presidents of the ASA, Rodriguez’s recognition of the absence of statistics from data science and his strategy to focus on what statisticians do best is amplified and augmented:</p>
<p>Ideally, statistics and statisticians should be the leaders of the Big Data and data science movement. Realistically, we must take a different view. While our discipline is certainly central to any data analysis context, <em>the scope of Big Data and data science goes far beyond our traditional activities.</em> As Bob [Rodriguez] noted in his column, the sheer scale and velocity of the data being generated from multiple sources requires new data management and computational paradigms. New techniques for analysis and visualization must be developed. And communication and leadership skills are critical.</p>
<p>We believe we should focus on what we need to do as a profession and as individuals to become valued contributors whose unique skills and expertise make us essential members of the Big Data team. . . . We know statistical thinking—our understanding of modeling, bias, confounding, false discovery, uncertainty, sampling, and design—brings much to the table. We also must be prepared to understand other ways of thinking that are critical in the Age of Big Data and to integrate these with our own expertise and knowledge.</p>
<p>We have had many discussions—among ourselves and with ASA members who are familiar with Big Data—about strategies for achieving this preparation and integration. These discussions have led to our joint ASA presidential initiative to establish the statistical profession as a valued partner in Big Data activities and to position the ASA in a proactive and facilitating role. <em>The goal is to prepare members of our profession to collaborate on Big Data problems.</em> Ultimately, this preparation will bridge the disconnect between statistics and data science (Rodriguez, Davidian, and Schenker 2013; emphases added).</p>
<p>Not all academic statisticians were willing to concede the point that data science “goes far beyond our traditional activities.” Indeed, many viewed data science as an invader of their territory. Bin Yu, then president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, exhorted her colleagues to “own data science” (Yu 2014), echoing Davidian’s exasperatated observation (and no doubt the sentiment of many) that statisticians “already are” data scientists. To make her point, she defined the core components of data science—statistics, domain knowledge, computing, teamwork, and communication—and then traced each of these to the traits of various ancestors in her field. In this narrative, Harry Carver, Herman Hollerrith, and John Tukey are all data scientists <em>avante la lettre</em>. Indeed, in Yu’s narrative Carver is an “early machine learner,” which allow her to claim machine learning as a province of statistics.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-academic-response"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> The Academic Response</h2>
<p>After 2012, the field of data science and the cluster of associated activities associated with it grew exponentially. As mentioned above, this growth was associated with a high demand for data scientists, a story that continues to be covered by the news media. The response by institutions of higher education to train data scientists to meet industry demand was rapid and pronounced. Hundreds of master’s degree programs in data science and closely related fields were established in the United States, often associated with the formation of institutes of data science. More recently, a handful of doctoral programs and schools of data science have emerged, along with undergraduate offerings to meet increasing student demand. The trend to create degree programs for the field continues.</p>
<p>One effect of these developments has been to stimulate a preferential attachment process within the network of disciplines that constitute the academy: as a field representing the “sexiest job of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,” attracting students, gifts, and internal resources, many adjacent disciplines—from systems engineering and computer science to statistics and a variety of quantitative and computational sciences—have sought to associate themselves with the field. Indeed, because data science per se has had no history in the academy, these contiguous fields have provided the courses and faculty out of which the majority of data science programs have been built. The result is that data science has become a complex and internally competitive patchwork of industrial and academic interests and perspectives, reflecting the broader engagement of society with data and its analysis beyond the concept of data science inherited from industry.</p>
<p>Yu’s argument that statistics should take over data science is made again later, and more thoroughly, by Donoho in “50 Years of Data Science” (Donoho 2017), which is essentially a manifesto for the annexation of data science by departments of statistics in response to the proliferation of academic programs associated with the new field. He charts out the territory of “Greater Data Science” (GDS)—a playful reversal of Chambers’ earlier plea for a “greater statistics” that would be “based on an inclusive concept of learning from data”—and places statistics at its center (Chambers 1993: 1). He locates GDS in a genealogy that begins with data analysis—a practice envisioned in the 1960s by his mentor at Princeton, the legendary mathematician John Tukey, who serves as the founding ancestor in this legitimation narrative. GDS is thus defined as “a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ‘scaling up’ to ‘big data’” (Donoho 2017 [2015]: 745). He also attempts to deflate the concept of big data, so central to contempory data science, by citing the Holerith’s punched card system, which was invented to process the unexpectedly large volume of data produced by the 1890 US census, as an early instance and therefore nothing new. Like Yu, Donoho’s argument is that, beyond the introducing a few useful technologies, data science as a whole is nothing new. It is a scandal that it has emerged outside of the field of statistics and is represented in the media as a distinct field.</p>
<p>Donoho’s essay has been criticized for downplaying the contribution of computational technology to data science. In his response to it, Chris Wiggins, Chief Data Scientist of the <em>New York Times</em> and a professor at Columbia, sensed this and asserted that data science is a form of engineering that will be defined by its practitioners, not by academics trying to turn it into a (pure) science. In his response, Sean Owen, Director of Data Science at Cloudera, argued that Donoho’s history excluded the significant contributions of data engineering (Donoho 2017: 764). Elsewhere, Bryan and Wickham pointed out that, like many statisticians, Donoho mistakenly relegated computational work to superficial status while also missing “the full process of analysis” in which statistics “is but one small part” (Bryan and Wickham 2017). In his defense, Donoho acknowledged his bias, but justified it by noting that although technological know-how is important, technologies are transitory and prone to rapid obsolescence, and therefore “the academic community can best focus on teaching broad principles—‘science’ rather than ‘engineering’” (Donoho 2017: 765). <em>Scientia longa, brevis ars.</em></p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this essay to fully evaluate the arguments of Donoho and Yu. Suffice it to say that when Facebook was hiring data scientists in 2008, the fact that someone’s academic field could claim Hollerith and Carver as data scientists would not have improved that candidate’s chances of being hired. What is significant here for understanding the history of data science is the social underpinning of the observed disconnect between members of the established field of statistics and those of the emerging one of data science. By 2012, Breiman’s observation that the developments in algorithmic modeling, and more generally data mining, “occurred largely outside statistics in a new community,” was proven to be both true and prescient: that new community became one of the primary tributaries to data science, and the long standing opposition of statistics toward the beliefs of that community—evident in Donoho and the predecessors he cites in the 1990s and early 2000s—became manifest.</p>
