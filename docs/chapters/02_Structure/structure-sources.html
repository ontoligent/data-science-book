<p>The primary sources on which the conclusions of this essay are based comprise a variety of documents, from technical journals to blog posts to internal reports. They come from a range of viewpoints, from data analysis and statistics to data mining and data science <em>per se</em>. For the purposes of the essay, we select a more or less representative subset across these axes of variation. With respect to representativeness, in some cases a document was chosen for its influence, in others, such as the post by Dataman, because it is considered more or less typical of a common genre.</p>
<p>The documents chosen are listed below in chronological order, beginning with Tukey’s seminal essay on data analysis and ending with contempory explainers. Included also are the definitions of the CRISP-DM and KDD processes which are the most developed pipeline models.</p>
<p>Each source entry below contains a short description of the source and its context, and then a list of the phases cited by the authors as fundamental to data processing. These phases are also mapped onto the standard sequence described in the main part of this essay, listed here for convenience.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understand</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Collect</li>
<li>Store</li>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Explore</li>
<li>Prepare</li>
<li>Model</li>
<li>Interpret</li>
<li>Communicate</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Reflect</li>
</ol>
<p>Mappings are indicated by an arrow pointing to the subset of terms from the standard sequence, e.g.&nbsp;… <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Explore]\)</span> These mappings are also aggregated into a composite pipeline and displayed the table below; each model row is referenced by its key as defined in the entries.</p>
<p>Note that in most cases these phases are explicitly described as a process and often as a pipeline. When they are not, the implication is strong. In some cases, the process is likened to a cycle, emphasizing the connection between the endpoints of the pipeline, which is also emphasized by the 4+1 model.</p>
<p>A final feature added to each entry is a two-value indicator of bias — statistics and data mining. This is meant to capture the intellectual origin of the model, given that statistics and data mining define the poles of one of main axes of variance that defines the field of data science. This difference roughly corresponds to the “two cultures” described by Breiman <span class="citation" data-cites="breimanStatisticalModelingTwo2001">Breiman (<a href="../../references.html#ref-breimanStatisticalModelingTwo2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.</p>

Bias: Statistics</p>
<p>In this classic essay, Tukey introduces the concept of data analysis, which he distinguishes from mathematical statistics and likens to an empirical science. He defines data analysis as an empirical process with phases including “… procedures for <strong>analyzing</strong> data, techniques for <strong>interpreting</strong> the results of such procedures, ways of <strong>planning</strong> the <strong>gathering</strong> of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data” (p.&nbsp;2). Unpacking this statement yields a four phase model.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: This phase includes “ways of planning the the gather of data to make its analysis easier.” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Plan]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Gathering</strong>: The gathering of data, either through creation or by acquisition of “data already obtained” (p.&nbsp;40). Includes also the shaping of data “to make its analysis easier,” which corresponds to our concept of Preparation. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Collect, Prepare]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Analyzing</strong>: This is where data are analyzed with “all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics.” <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Explore, Model]\)</span></li>

Bias: Data Mining<br>
</p>
<p>KDD, or Knowledge Discovery in Databases, emerged in the late 1980s as both datasets and the computational resources to work with them became abundant. These resources included commercial databases and personal computers. In many ways the most adjacent field to contemoporary data science, this approach is unabashedly dedicated to finding patterns in data prior to developing a probabilistic model to justify their use. Fayyad’s essay identifies five steps <span class="citation" data-cites="fayyadKnowledgeDiscoveryData1996">(<a href="../../references.html#ref-fayyadKnowledgeDiscoveryData1996" role="doc-biblioref">Fayyad et al. 1996</a>: 84)</span>. He emphasizes the highly iterative and cyclical nature of the process, arguing that it “may contain loops between any two steps.” Another significant aspect of this conception of the pipeline is the role of exploration in the analytical phase: “Data Mining is a step in the KDD process consisting of applying data analysis and discovery algorithms that, under acceptable computational efficiency limitations, produce a particular enumeration of patterns over the data ….” (p.&nbsp;83)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Selection</strong>: Creating a target data set, or focusing on a subset of variables or data samples, on which discovery is to be performed. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Collect]\)</span></li>

Bias: Statistics</p>
<p>The SEMMA model was developed the by SAS institute in 1996 as part of the documentation for their product, SAS Enterprise Miner. Even so, the model is referenced outside of this context, often as a comparison to KDD and CRISP-DM. Its bias towards statististics is evident in the first step.</p>

Bias: Statistics</p>
<p>The Japanese statistician Chikio Hayashi adopted the term “data science” in the early 1990s to define a field that did not succumb to what he saw to be the errors of both statistics and data analysis. He argued that mathematical statistics had become too attached to problems of inference and removed from reality, while data analysis had lost interest in understanding the meaning of the data it deals with. His definition of data science is decidely processual: “Data Science consists of three phases: design for data, collection of data and analysis on data. It is important that the three phases are treated with the concept of unification based on the fundamental philosophy of science …. In these phases the methods which are fitted for the object and are valid, must be studied with a good perspective.” (p.&nbsp;41) Similar to KDD and CRISM-PM, Hayashi envisioned this process as a spiral, oscillating between poles if what he called “diversification” and “simplification.” Note also that each of these terms, as described, comprises more than on of the standard sequence phases.</p>

Bias: Data Mining</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, the practice of data mining had become widespread in industry and globally. In 1999 the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) was developed in Europe as a comprehensive and general model to support the use of data mining in a broad range of sectors in a principled manner. Designed to work within a project management framework, this model is by far the most developed, and it continues to influence the field of data science to this day. Like KDD before it, the model emphasizes the cyclic and recursive nature of the process, and this perspective is reflected in the circular diagram that often accompanies its presentation. The steps below are based on the summary presented in Wirth and Hipp’s essay.</p>

<p>After the phrase “data science” went viral (circa 2009), there were many efforts to make sense of the idea. In 2010 Drew Conway posted his Venn diagram of data science <span class="citation" data-cites="conwayDataScienceVenn2010">(<a href="../../references.html#ref-conwayDataScienceVenn2010" role="doc-biblioref">Conway 2010</a>)</span>. The same year, another influential model, based explicitly on the pipeline, came from Mason and Wiggins in a blog post hosted at O’Reilly’s Tech Radar site. In contrast to previous models rooted in statistics, this model assumes that data are abundant and available, such as data scrapable from the Web.</p>

<p>By 2014, data science had become a widespread practice in industry and the academic, and explanations of its nature became the subject of many books. This text is one of a genre that presents the field as a process, perhaps due to the influence of the CRISP-DM and OSEMI models, and uses the expression pipeline throughout. Note that the model defined in this book is not presented here as canonical. It suffers from various inconsistences, such as the labeling of steps in the text representation of the pipeline versus those on diagrams. It is included to demonstrate the pervasiveness of the model.</p>

<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Acquire the data from relational databases, NoSQL and document stores, web scraping, distributed databases (e.g.&nbsp;HDFS on a Hadoop platform), RESTful APIs, flat files, etc. Consistent with the other data mining models, the emphasis here is on working with available data, not generating it. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Collect]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Exploration and understanding</strong>: Understand the data and how it was collected or produced; this often requires significant exploration.

<p>By 2015, many universities had begun offering degrees in data science, typically at the masters’ level, with the intention of meeting the high demand for data scientists. Professors Caffo, Peng, and Leek’s book was written to accompany a course in Exectutive Data Science, offered by Johns Hopkins University through <em>Coursera</em>. Their model is relatively high level, consisting of five phases, given the target audience of those in charge of data science teams. As with other models, this model emphasizes the iterative nature of each phase, both internally and between phases. And as with many statistics-oriented conceptions of data science, this model emphasizes the Understand phase and skips over the technical issues of storing and modeling the data.</p>

<p>As data science became viral in the 2010s, academic statisticians frequently expressed concern that they were “disconnected from the new (and vaguely defined) community of data scientists, who are completely identified with Big Data in the eyes of the media and policymakers” <span class="citation" data-cites="rodriguezBigDataBetter2012">(<a href="../../references.html#ref-rodriguezBigDataBetter2012" role="doc-biblioref">Rodriguez 2012</a>)</span>. “Aren’t <em>We</em> Data Scientists?” asked Marie Davidian, then president of the American Statistical Association, in 2013 <span class="citation" data-cites="davidianArenWeData2013">(<a href="../../references.html#ref-davidianArenWeData2013" role="doc-biblioref">Davidian 2013</a>)</span>. In response to this growing sentiment, Donoho’s essay reads as a manifesto for the reclaiming of data science by academic statistics. In it, he defines six divisions of Greater Data Science, each containing a set of subactivities that roughly map to the pipeline model described here.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Donoho’s model is more abstract than a pipeline description and therefore not all of the divisions and subactivities directly map onto the sequence. <strong>Data visualization and Presentation</strong> defines a general practice, although from the description it clearly maps onto two phases, Explore and Communicate. <strong>Computing with Data</strong> refers to knowledge of programming languages for data analysis and data processing as well as knowledge of how to use cluster and cloud computing resources at scale. It also includes how to develop workflows which organize work. Clearly, this area belongs to no phase in particular but instead characterizes the broader context in which the data science pipeline operates. The identification of workflows, which are the focus of the Science about Data Science division, also suggests that Donoho is working at a higher level of abstraction than the other models, which places it alongside the of the current essay. The following phases are inferred from Donoho’s descriptions.</p>

<p>Géron’s text is a classic among practicing data scientists interested in using machine learning in a business setting, covering everything from regression to deep learning from a practical, code-centric perspective. Written with “minimal theory,” the book demostrates the entrenched nature of the pipeline model, especially as it has been become a software development pattern hard-coded into both SciKit Learn and TensorFlow. This usage reflects the fact that within machine learning, “pipeline” has taken on a more specific meaning — “a sequence of data processing components” — than we are using here. These components are units software within a system, not the phases of labor associated with the work of the data scientist. Nevertheless, Géron’s text describes a labor pipeline within which the software pipeline is embedded, the steps of an “end-to-end” classification project.</p>

<p>Another example of a self-published explainer essay, this one describes the data science “modeling process” and aligns it with six consultative roles. The other defines eight steps to the process. Curiously, althhough this pipeline focuses on the details of training models, it does not include training the model itself as a step.</p>
<ol type="1">

<li><strong>Communicate with key stakeholders</strong>: This step involves ongoing aligning expected outcomes with key stakeholders.

<li><strong>Determine the functional form of the model</strong>: In this step, the specific from of the model is defined, including the definition and characterization of the target variable. This step involves model selection and would in practice be closely associated with the next. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Prepare, Model]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Split the data into training and validation</strong> This step is concerned with model validation and avoiding overfitting. Data are divided into training and test datasets. It is assumed that test data were separated out prior to the preceding step. Presumably this step includes fitting the models, but this is not explicit. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Prepare, Model]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Assess the model performance</strong>: This step includes determining the stability of a model over time (generalizability), focusing on the overall fit of the model, the significance of each predictor, and the relationship between the target variable and each predictor. Includes measures such as lift. Clearly this step follows the process of fitting and tuning models. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Model]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Deploy the model for real-time prediction</strong>: The deployment of machine learning models into production, e.g.&nbsp;via batch prediction as a webservice. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Deploy]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Re-build the model</strong>: This step involves revisiting the pipeline as models lose their predictability due to a variety of causes. Effectively, this step asserts the cyclic and interative nature of the pipeline and therefore belongs to no step in particular.</li>

<p>Michael Porter is an Associate Professor of Data Science and Systems Engineering at the UVA. This essay is an internal report (available on request) on the field of data science from the perspective of curricular planning. Porter argues that Data Science includes seven areas, each of which can be viewed as a science, i.e.&nbsp;as requiring specific expertise. Like Donoho’s essay (and the current), the model presented is more abstract than a pipeline model and includes areas that cross-cut steps in the Primary Sequence. Nevertheless, it retains a sequential structure consistent with the general pattern.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Collection and Acquisition</strong>: The science of “how” and “when” data is collected, and includes all methods of data acquisition from its production through designed experiments to its consumption from external sources, e.g.&nbsp;databases and APIs. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Collect]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Data Storage and Representation</strong>: The science of “how” and “when” data is collected, including data modeling and storing data in databases and files of various formats. Also includes transforming data into “tidy” format. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Store]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Data Manipulation and Transformation</strong>: The science of preparing data for analysis, including wrangling, cleaning, and importing data from databases (after they have been stored in the previous step). <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Clean, Prepare]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Computing with Data</strong>: The science of computing for data analysis with a focus on algorithm design and performance evaluation. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Model]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Data Analytics</strong>: The science of machine learning, broadly conceived to include methods ranging from geneative modeling (either frequentist or Bayesian) and inference to predictive modeling and optimization. Notably, this step also includes EDA and feature engineering. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Explore, Prepare, Model]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Summarizing and Communicating Data and Models</strong>: The science of extracting and summarizing the information in data for human understanding. This area includes visualization in the context of both EDA and presentation of results to external stakeholders. It also includes the communication of model and data properties (such as bias) to guide interpretation of results. Here we map it to the latter, but note that this area includes at least two steps. In addition, we may may the work of summarization to interpretation. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Interpret, Communicate]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Practicing Data Science</strong>: The science of the overall system of data science, including improving the data science spipeline, replicability of results, openness and transparency, project management, etc. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Reflect]\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Disciplinary Data Science</strong>: The science of applying data science to specific disciplines. This involves a consideration of how the pipeline operates in different contexts, including how domain knowledge informs each of the steps of the pipeline, from mode of data acquisition to model selection and analytic appraoch, to the interpretation and communication of results. Although placed at the end of the list, it properly belongs to the initial <span class="math inline">\(Understand\)</span> step. <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow [Understand]\)</span></li>

## Variations 

**Shape**

* Linear
* Circular

**Granularity**

* Few
* Many -- see CRISP-DM and levels of description.

**Abstraction**

* Pipeline stages only
* Pipeline stages and cross-cutting, abstract principles

## Other Comments

* The place of "exploration"
* Changes in order are bound
* The explicit and the implicit. Sometimes unspecified steps are implied; other times their absence is telling.

<!--
## Comments
-   Place of clustering
-   Place of explorations
-   Cycles and pipes
-   Missing steps, implicit steps
-   Differences in order mostly confined to groups
-   Right even when wrong -- the end points $I$ and $V$, and the middle $III$, remain constant; the arms, as it were, are where it gets messy.
-   Actually, two models -- pipeline and cycle ... Both are sequences, and both stress repetition . . .
