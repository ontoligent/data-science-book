    "text": "Historically, there are two primary usages of “data science”: the classical and the statistical. These linguistic usages index two traditions of working with data that continue to this day, where they have met and mingle in the context of the academy along with many other adjacent disciplines. Data science today is characterized by this encounter; it is hoped that an understanding of the origins of our words and ideas in this context will allow us to create a new and unified form of data science for the long-term.\nThe classical usage of data science can be traced to the 1960s in the US military-industrial sector. Among the governmental and commercial organizations that adopted the term at that time, the Data Sciences Lab of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) formed in 1963 stands out (AFCRL 1963). This lab established a paradigm that grew out of the need to dynamically process vast amounts of sensor data in real-time to support decision-making and modeling of complex phenomena. Central to this paradigm was the use of artificial intelligence and computer visualization to extract patterns from “data deluge”—what today we would call “big data.” Over time this usage evolved to include working with large, complex, and dynamic data sets in a variety of scientific fields, including physics, environmental science, and biology. This usage continues to this day in that area and in the data-driven sciences. It is represented by organizations like JISC, the NSF, and CODATA.\nA secondary but hugely influential variant of the classical usage appeared in Silicon Valley around 2008 (Hammerbacher 2009; Yau 2009). By 2012 it was famously promoted by Harvard Business Review when it dubbed data scientist the “sexiest job of the 21st century” (Davenport and Patil 2012). In this variant, the paradigm of classical data science jumped from the military-industrial and scientific sectors to the commercial sector of so-called surveillance capitalism (Zuboff 2019). In this sector the usage became wildly popular (achieving buzzword status), prompting a high demand for data scientists in industry as well as for authoritative explanations of the nature of the role. This in turn motivated the formation of numerous degree programs throughout the academy in the US. It also elicited a strong reaction from academic statisticians alarmed by the perceived disconnect between data science and their own field (Davidian 2013).\nThe statistical usage of data science began in Japan in the early 1990s among academic statisticians concerned with the threats and opportunities associated with computational statistics, data mining, and other developments relating to the rise of available computing and surplus data. Chikio Hayashi appears to have coined this usage in 1992(Ohsumi 2002); it was adopted by his student Noboru Ohsumi in 1994 and by 1996 the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) adopted it as part of a conference title (Ohsumi 1994; Hayashi 1998). This began a long engagement with data science that continues to this day in Europe and Japan. A parallel but shorter-lived version of this usage emerged in the US between 1996 and 2001 when a small group of academic statisticians unsuccessfully exhorted their field to brand itself as data science and embrace new developments in computational statistics and machine learning (Kettenring 1997; Wu 1997; Cleveland 2001). A third iteration of this usage was developed by traditional statisticians who viewed the rise of second-wave classical data science as a threat to their field that must be “owned”(Rodriguez 2012; Davidian 2013; Yu 2014; “ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science” 2015; Donoho 2017).\nThese origins shed light on the specific characteristics of each tradition and why they sometimes are at odds with each other over fundamental questions.\nThe classical usage developed in the context of an historically unique assemblage of networked data-generating and computational machinery that characterized post-war military and scientific endeavors. The primary problem faced in this context is what we can call data impedance—the endemic disproportion between the production of data by signal-generating instruments—from satellites and particle accelerators to, nowadays, smart phones and credit cards—capturing a wide range of natural and behavioral phenomena, and the ability to process and interpret these data, often rapidly, by means of computational machinery. In this context, data science emerged as an eclectic form of expertise associated with the pipeline of activities that begins with the acquisition of data, often from non-experimental sources, to its reduction and modeling, to its visualization and interpretation. The skills and values associated with this pipeline have been remarkably consistent from the 1960s to the present time—for example the ability to work with what 3D data, the focus on computational methods in place of analytic ones, and the premium placed on the visualization and communication of results to drive decision-making.\nBy contrast, the statistical usage developed in the context of a well-established academic field reacting to external developments—the very developments within which classical data science emerged. Each of the three variants of the statistical usage was motivated by the perceived threats and opportunities opened by computational methods and the growing surplus of data being captured by databases and shared over networks. A recurrent theme in this usage is an attraction to machine learning methods developed primarily by computer scientists and a repulsion to data mining, perceived as an unprincipled collection of methods lacking in experimental design and mathematical grounding. In this context, data science emerged as a new form of statistics that would encompass and enhance the good parts of the new computational methods while throwing away the bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nAFCRL. 1963. “Report on Research at AFCRL: July 1962 - July 1963.” Bedford, Mass.\n\n\n“ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science.” 2015, August.\n\n\nCleveland, William S. 2001. “Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics.” International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique 69 (1): 21–26. https://doi.org/10.2307/1403527.\n\n\nDavenport, Thomas H., and D.
