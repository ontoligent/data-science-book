    "text": "Historically, there are two primary usages of “data science”: the classical and the statistical.\nThe classical usage began in the 1960s in the US military-industrial sector and continues to this day in that area and in the data-driven sciences. Among various public and private organizations that adopted the term at that time, the Data Sciences Lab of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories formed in 1963 stands out (AFCRL 1963). This lab established a paradigm that grew out of the need to dynamically process vast amounts of sensor data—dubbed “data deluge” since the 1950s—in real-time to support decision-making and modeling of complex phenomena. This lab pioneered the use of artificial intelligence and computer visualization to extract patterns from new forms of data. Over time this usage evolved to include working with large, complex, and dynamic data sets in a variety of scientific fields, including physics, environmental science, and biology.\nA secondary development of the classical usage began in Silicon Valley around 2008 and was famously promoted by Harvard Business Review in 2012 when it called data scientist the “sexiest job of the 21st century” (Davenport and Patil 2012). In this usage, the paradigm of classical data science jumped from the military-industrial and scientific sectors to the commercial sector of so-called surveillance capitalism (Zuboff 2019). In this context the usage became wildly popular, prompting a high demand for data scientists in industry as well as for authoritative explanations of the nature of the role. This in turn motivated the formation of numerous degree programs throughout the academy in the US, typically in the form of masters degrees. It also elicited a strong reaction from academic statisticians alarmed by the perceived disconnect between data science and their own field (Davidian 2013).\nThe statistical usage began in Japan in the early 1990s among academic statisticians concerned with the threats and opportunities associated with computational statistics, data mining, and other developments relating to the rise of available computing and surplus data. Chikio Hayashi coined this usage in 1992(Ohsumi 2002); by 1996 the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) adopted it and began a long engagement with data science that continues to this day in Europe and Japan(Hayashi 1998). A parallel but shorter-lived version of this usage emerged in the US between 1996 and 2001 when a small group of academic statisticians unsuccessfully exhorted the field to brand itself as data science and embrace new developments in computational statistics and machine learning (Kettenring 1997; Wu 1997; Cleveland 2001). A third iteration of this usage was developed by traditional statisticians who viewed the rise of second-wave classical data science as a threat to their field that must be “owned”(Rodriguez 2012; Davidian 2013; Yu 2014; “ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science” 2015; Donoho 2017).\nThe classical usage developed in the context of an historically unique assemblage of networked data-generating and computational machinery that characterized post-war military and scientific endeavors. The primary problem faced in this context is what we can call data impedance—the endemic disproportion between the production of data by signal-generating instruments—from satellites and particle accelerators to smart phones and credit cards—capturing a wide range of natural and behavioral phenomena, and the ability to process and interpret these data, often rapidly, by means of computational machinery. In this context, data science emerged as an eclectic form of expertise associated with the pipeline of activities that begins with the acquisition of data, often from non-experimental sources, to its reduction and modeling, to its visualization and interpretation.\nBy contrast, the statistical usage developed in the context of an established academic field reacting to the very developments within which classical data science emerged. Each iteration of this usage was motivated by the perceived threats and opportunities opened by computational methods and the growing surplus of data being captured by databases and shared over networks. A recurrent theme in this usage is an attraction to machine learning methods developed primarily by computer scientists and a repulsion to data mining, perceived as an unprincipled collection of methods lacking in experimental design and mathematical grounding. In this context, data science emerged as a rebranded form of statistics that would encompass and enhance the good parts of the new computational methods while throwing away the bad.\n\n\n\n\nAFCRL. 1963. “Report on Research at AFCRL: July 1962 - July 1963.” Bedford, Mass.\n\n\n“ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science.” 2015, August.\n\n\nCleveland, William S. 2001. “Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics.” International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique 69 (1): 21–26. https://doi.org/10.2307/1403527.\n\n\nDavenport, Thomas H., and D.
